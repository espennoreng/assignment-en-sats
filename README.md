### How I would have improved the app
1. Connect the app to a database, or at least use state to store, add and update the data. That way I could make made use of the buttons.
2. The waiting list is hardcoded with a margin, I could have fixed this with a grid layout.
3. I could have added more componets, i.e on the session-details page

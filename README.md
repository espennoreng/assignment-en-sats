## Getting Started

First install the dependencies and then run the development server:

```bash
npm install 
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Info
Most of the code in just boilerplate code from Next.js. I have only added code in the app/ folder, the _components, _helpers and _types folders, and in the page.tsx file.

### How I would have improved the app
1. Connect the app to a database, or at least use state to store, add and update the data. That way I could make made use of the buttons.
2. The waiting list is hardcoded with a margin, I could have fixed this with a grid layout.
3. I could have added more componets, i.e on the session-details page
